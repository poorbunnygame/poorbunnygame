## Poor Bunny

<strong><a href="https://poorbunnygame.github.io/">Poor Bunny</a></strong> is an engaging skill game with a difficult obstacle course. To eat all the delicious carrots, you take control of a cute rabbit figure. While avoiding increasingly deadly traps that appear out of nowhere, hop on and off platforms. When the golden carrot shows up, don't pass it up since it's worth five ordinary carrots. More than a hundred bunnies can be unlocked with the carrots you've collected. This game can be played with or without a partner in local cooperative or competitive modes. Don't forget to get your friends to visit Poor Bunny so you can compare your outcomes! 

The mechanics of Poor Bunny are quite basic, but it would take a long time to fully understand them. Like other difficult platformers, this extensive journey has its own controls, game modes, and regulations that call for deft maneuvers.

Once you're in the in-game forest, you must exercise utmost caution. A yearning rush turns you into a cuddly rabbit. You are constantly chasing after carrots, your life energy, since your hunger is limitless. Randomly, the brilliant orange prize will show up in various locations. You have to jump and navigate platforms, using the ledges to grab the object you want. 

Every "hunt" that you complete raises your score and gets you one step closer to obtaining amazing milestones. The elusive golden carrots are worth three to five conventional carrots, so keep an eye out for them! A full wardrobe of amazing new skins will become available to you as your point total increases. Do you want to be a ninja bunny and jump around? Or a bunny from space? It's up to you!

## A variety of inventive and hazardous obstacles

The catch for poor Bunny is that each round only gives you one chance to win glory. As your carrot count rises, you encounter more terrible obstacles in the forest. These traps grow increasingly varied as you play:

<li>Raining arrows that create a shower of spikes in the sky.</li>

<li>Unexpected chainsaws exploded from the earth.</li>

<li>Cannons that fire projectiles with extreme precision.</li>

<li>Rotating blades that cut through the atmosphere.</li>

<li>There are still a lot of shocks that could end your run.</li>

Recall that the game ends if you even come close to these obstacles. Because of this, every successful run is extremely exciting. Thus, maintain your quick reflexes and accurate leaps—your next big score is just around the corner!

## Various hopping techniques

Poor Bunny has three modes of operation:

<li>1P: A lone runner, allowing you to freely traverse the dangerous area on your own. This mode is perfect for anyone who wants to learn the art of carrot collection at their own pace.</li>

<li>2P: In this mode, cooperation with another player is required. The final point total will be the number of carrots you both gather. In this friendship-building phase, your success will be determined by your combined wit and teamwork.</li>

<li>In the mode known as "VS," friends and family members engage in a fierce battle to gather carrots. Take on your rivals to see who is really deserving of the title of victor.</li>

With the distinct difficulties and rewards offered by each mode, you can enjoy the chase in any way you choose.
